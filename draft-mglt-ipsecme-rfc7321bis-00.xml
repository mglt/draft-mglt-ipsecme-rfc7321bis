<abstract>

<t>This document updates the Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for ESP
and AH. The goal of these document is to enable ESP and AH to benefit from cryptography 
that is up to date while making IPsec interoperable.</t>

<t>This document obsoletes RFC 7321 on the cryptographic recommendations only.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

<t>The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303"/> and
the Authentication Header (AH) <xref target="RFC4302"/> are the
mechanisms for applying cryptographic protection to data being sent over
an IPsec Security Association (SA) <xref target="RFC4301"/>.</t>



<t>This document provides guidance and recommendations so that ESP and AH can be used with a cryptographic algorithms that are up to date. The challenge of such document is to make sure that over the time IPsec implementations can use secure and up-to-date cryptographic algorithms while keeping IPsec interoperable.</t>


     <section title="Updating Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance">
      <t> The field of cryptography evolves continuously. New stronger
      algorithms appear and existing algorithms are found to be less
      secure then originally thought. Therefore, algorithm
      implementation requirements and usage guidance need to be
      updated from time to time to reflect the new reality. The
      choices for algorithms must be conservative to minimize the risk
      of algorithm compromise. Algorithms need to be suitable for a
      wide variety of CPU architectures and device deployments ranging
      from high end bulk encryption devices to small low-power IoT
      devices.</t>

      <t> The algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance
      may need to change over time to adapt to the changing world. For
      this reason, the selection of mandatory-to-implement algorithms
      was removed from the main IKEv2 specification and placed in a
      separate document. </t>

     </section>


     <section title="Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels">
      <t>The mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should
      already be available in most implementations of AH/ESP by the time
      it is made mandatory. This document attempts to identify and
      introduce those algorithms for future mandatory-to-implement
      status. There is no guarantee that the algorithms in use today
      may become mandatory in the future. Published algorithms are
      continuously subjected to cryptographic attack and may become
      too weak or could become completely broken before this document
      is updated.</t>

      <t> This document only provides recommendations for the
      mandatory-to-implement algorithms or algorithms too weak that
      are recommended not to be implemented. As a result, any
      algorithm listed at the IPsec IANA registry not mentioned in
      this document MAY be implemented. For clarification and
      consistency with <xref target="RFC7321"/> an algorithm will be
      denoted here as MAY only when it has been downgraded.</t>

      <t> Although this document updates the algorithms to keep the
      AH/ESP communication secure over time, it also aims at providing
      recommendations so that AH/ESP implementations remain
      interoperable. AH/ESP interoperability is addressed by an
      incremental introduction or deprecation of algorithms. In
      addition, this document also considers the new use cases for
      AH/ESP deployment, such as Internet of Things (IoT).</t>

      <t> It is expected that deprecation of an algorithm is performed
      gradually. This provides time for various implementations to
      update their implemented algorithms while remaining
      interoperable. Unless there are strong security reasons, an
      algorithm is expected to be downgraded from MUST to MUST- or
      SHOULD, instead of MUST NOT. Similarly, an algorithm that has
      not been mentioned as mandatory-to-implement is expected to be
      introduced with a SHOULD instead of a MUST.</t>

      <t>The current trend toward Internet of Things and its adoption
      of AH/ESP requires this specific use case to be taken into
      account as well. IoT devices are resource constrained devices
      and their choice of algorithms are motivated by minimizing the
      footprint of the code, the computation effort and the size of
      the messages to send. This document indicates "[IoT]" when a
      specified algorithm is specifically listed for IoT devices.
      Requirement levels that are marked as "IoT" apply to IoT devices
      and to server-side implementations that might presumably need to
      interoperate with them, including any general-purpose VPN
      gateways.</t>
      
     </section>

     <section title="Document Audience">
      <t>The recommendations of this document mostly target AH/ESP
      implementers as implementations need to meet both high security
      expectations as well as high interoperability between various
      vendors and with different versions. Interoperability requires a
      smooth move to more secure cipher suites. This may differ from a
      user point of view that may deploy and configure AH/ESP with only
      the safest cipher suite.</t>

      <t>This document does not give any recommendations for the use
      of algorithms, it only gives implementation recommendations for
      implementations. The use of algorithms by users is dictated by
      the security policy requirements for that specific user, and are
      outside the scope of this document.</t>

     </section>

</section> 

<section title="Requirements Language">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

<t>Following <xref target="RFC4835"/>, we define some additional key
words:</t>

<t><list style="hanging">

<t hangText="MUST-"> This term means the same as MUST. However, we
expect that at some point in the future this algorithm will no
longer be a MUST.</t>

<t hangText="SHOULD+"> This term means the same as SHOULD.
However, it is likely that an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be
promoted at some future time to be a MUST.</t>

          <postamble>
          [1] - This requirement level is for 128-bit keys. 256-bit keys are at SHOULD.
          192-bit keys can safely be ignored.
          [IoT] - This requirement is for interoperability with IoT.           
            </postamble>
        </texttable>

         <t>IPsec sessions may have very long life time, and carry multiple packets, 
         so there is a need to move 256-bit keys in the long term. For that purpose 
         requirement level is for 128 bit keys and 256 bit keys are at SHOULD 
         (when applicable). In that sense 256 bit keys status has been raised from 
         MAY in RFC7321 to SHOULD.
         </t>   

         <t>NULL status remains to MUST to enable the use of ESP with only authentication. 
         It status is expected to remain MUST by protocol requirements.</t> 
         <t>ENCR_AES_CBC status remains to MUST in order to enable interoperability 
         between  implementation that followed RFC7321.</t>
         <t>AES-GCM status has been updated from SHOULD+ to MUST in order to favor 
         the use of authenticated encryption and AEAD algorithms.
         The main motivation for adopting AES-GCM for ESP is performance 
         as well as key longevity - compared to AES-CBC for example. This resulted in 
         AES-GCM widely implemented for ESP.</t>
         <t> ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 was not ready to be considered at the time of RFC7321.
         It has been recommended by the CRFG and others as an alternative to AES and AES-GCM. 
         It is also being standardized for IPsec for the same reasons. At the time of writing, 
         there were not enough ESP implementations of ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 to be able to 
         introduce it at the SHOULD+ level.</t>
         <t>ENCR_AES_CCM_8-16 status have been raised from MAY to SHOULD. This document 
         considers it SHOULD be implemented in order to be able to interact with Internet
         of Things devices. As this case is not a general use case for VPNs, its status is
         expected to remain to SHOULD.</t> 
         <t>ENCR_3DES status has been downgraded from  MAY in RFC7321 to SHOULD NOT. 
         However, ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 seems a more modern approach alternative to AES than 3DES
         and so it expected to be favored over 3DES.</t>
         <t>ENCR_DES status remains to MUST NOT.</t>

<section title="ESP and AH Authentication Algorithms">

<t>Encryption without authentication MUST NOT be used. As a result, authentication algorithm recommendations in this section are targeting two types of communications: Firstly authenticated only communications without encryption -- such communications can be ESP with NULL encryption or AH communications.  
Secondly, communications that are encrypted with non AEAD encryption algorithms mentioned above. In this case, they MUST be combined with an authentication algorithm.</t>

          [IoT] - This requirement is for interoperability with IoT 
            </postamble>
        </texttable>
        <t>HMAC_SHA2_256_128 was not mentioned in RFC7321, as no SHA2 based authentication
        was mentioned. HMAC_SHA2_256_128 SHOULD be implemented  in order to replace HMAC_SHA1_96.</t>
        <t>HMAC_SHA2_512_256 SHOULD be implemented as a future replacement of 
        HMAC_SHA2_256_128 or when stronger security is required. This value has been preferred
        to HMAC_SHA2_384, as the overhead of HMAC_SHA2_512 is negligible.</t>
        <t> HMAC_SHA1_96 status has been downgraded from MUST in RFC7321 to MUST- as 
        there is an industry-wide trend to deprecate its usage.</t>
        <t> AES-XCBC is only recommended in the scope of IoT, as Internet of Things 
        deployments tend to prefer AES based HMAC functions in  order to avoid
        implementing SHA2. For the wide VPN deployment, as it has not been widely adopted,
        it has been downgraded from SHOULD in RFC4307 to MAY.</t>
        <t>AES-128-GMAC status is being upgraded from SHOULD+ to MUST in order to guarantee
        interoperability between implementation that are following RFC7321 and this document.
        In fact HMAC-SHA1-96 was used to be the algorithm that provided interoperability
        and it has been downgraded.</t> 
        <t>AES-256-GMAC was not mentioned in RFC7321. Its status has been set to SHOULD 
        as as a future replacement of AES-128-GMAC or when stronger security is required.</t> 
        <t>NULL has been downgraded from MAY in RFC7321 to MUST NOT. The only reason NULL 
        is acceptable is when authenticated encryption algorithms are selected from 
        <xref target="sec-encr"/>. In any other case, NULL MUST NOT be selected. As ESP and
        AH provides both authentication, one may be tempted to combine these protocol to 
        provide authentication. As mentionned by RFC7321, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use 
        ESP with NULL authentication - with non authenticated encryption - in conjunction
        with AH; some configurations of this combination of services have been shown to be
        insecure <xref target="PD10"/>. In addition, ESP NULL authentication cannot be
        combined with ESP NULL encryption.</t>
