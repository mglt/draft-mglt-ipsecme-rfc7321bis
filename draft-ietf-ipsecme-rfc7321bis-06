<abstract>

<t>This document updates the Cryptographic Algorithm Implementation Requirements for ESP
and AH. The goal of these document is to enable ESP and AH to benefit from cryptography 
that is up to date while making IPsec interoperable.</t>

<t>This document obsoletes RFC 7321 on the cryptographic recommendations only.</t>

<section title="Introduction">

     <t>The Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP) <xref target="RFC4303"/> and
     the Authentication Header (AH) <xref target="RFC4302"/> are the
     mechanisms for applying cryptographic protection to data being sent over
     an IPsec Security Association (SA) <xref target="RFC4301"/>.</t>

     <t>This document provides guidance and recommendations so that ESP and
     AH can be used with a cryptographic algorithms that are up to date.
     The challenge of such document is to make sure that over the time 
     IPsec implementations can use secure and up-to-date cryptographic
     algorithms while keeping IPsec interoperable.</t>

     <section title="Updating Algorithm Implementation Requirements and Usage Guidance">
      <t> The field of cryptography evolves continuously. New stronger
      algorithms appear and existing algorithms are found to be less
      secure than originally thought. Therefore, algorithm
      implementation requirements and usage guidance need to be
      updated from time to time to reflect the new reality. The
      choices for algorithms must be conservative to minimize the risk
      of algorithm compromise. Algorithms need to be suitable for a
      wide variety of CPU architectures and device deployments ranging
      from high end bulk encryption devices to small low-power IoT
      devices.</t>

      <t> The algorithm implementation requirements and usage guidance
      may need to change over time to adapt to the changing world. For
      this reason, the selection of mandatory-to-implement algorithms
      was removed from the main Internet Key Exchange Protocol Version 2 (IKEv2) <xref target="RFC7296"/> specification and placed in a
      separate document. </t>
     </section>


     <section title="Updating Algorithm Requirement Levels">
      <t>The mandatory-to-implement algorithm of tomorrow should
      already be available in most implementations of AH/ESP by the time
      it is made mandatory. This document attempts to identify and
      introduce those algorithms for future mandatory-to-implement
      status. There is no guarantee that the algorithms in use today
      may become mandatory in the future. Published algorithms are
      continuously subjected to cryptographic attack and may become
      too weak or could become completely broken before this document
      is updated.</t>

      <t> This document only provides recommendations for the
      mandatory-to-implement algorithms and algorithms too weak that
      are recommended not to be implemented. As a result, any algorithm
      listed at the IPsec IANA registry not mentioned in this document
      MAY be implemented. It is expected that this document will be
      updated over time and next versions will only mention algorithms
      which status has evolved. For clarification when an algorithm has
      been mentioned in <xref target="RFC7321"/>, this document states
      explicitly the update of the status.</t>

      <t> Although this document updates the algorithms to keep the
      AH/ESP communication secure over time, it also aims at providing
      recommendations so that AH/ESP implementations remain
      interoperable. AH/ESP interoperability is addressed by an
      incremental introduction or deprecation of algorithms. In
      addition, this document also considers the new use cases for
      AH/ESP deployment, such as Internet of Things (IoT).</t>

      <t> It is expected that deprecation of an algorithm is performed
      gradually. This provides time for various implementations to
      update their implemented algorithms while remaining
      interoperable. Unless there are strong security reasons, an
      algorithm is expected to be downgraded from MUST to MUST- or
      SHOULD, instead of MUST NOT (see <xref target="sec-term"/> for a definition of the terminology). Similarly, an algorithm that has
      not been mentioned as mandatory-to-implement is expected to be
      introduced with a SHOULD instead of a MUST.</t>

      <t>The current trend toward Internet of Things and its adoption
      of AH/ESP requires this specific use case to be taken into
      account as well. IoT devices are resource constrained devices
      and their choice of algorithms are motivated by minimizing the
      footprint of the code, the computation effort and the size of
      the messages to send. This document indicates "(IoT)" when a
      specified algorithm is specifically listed for IoT devices.
      Requirement levels that are marked as "IoT" apply to IoT devices
      and to server-side implementations that might presumably need to
      interoperate with them, including any general-purpose Virtual Private Network (VPN)
      gateways.</t>
     </section>

     <section title="Document Audience">
      <t>The recommendations of this document mostly target AH/ESP
      implementers as implementations need to meet both high security
      expectations as well as high interoperability between various
      vendors and with different versions. Interoperability requires a
      smooth move to more secure cipher suites. This may differ from a
      user point of view that may deploy and configure AH/ESP with only
      the safest cipher suite.</t>

      <t>This document does not give any recommendations for the use
      of algorithms, it only gives implementation recommendations for
      implementations. The use of algorithms by users is dictated by
      the security policy requirements for that specific user, and are
      outside the scope of this document.</t>

      <t>The algorithms considered here are listed by the IANA as part 
      of the IKEv2 parameters. IKEv1 is out of scope of this document.
      IKEv1 is deprecated and the recommendations of this document must
      not be considered for IKEv1, nor IKEv1 parameters be considered by
      this document.</t>

      <t>The IANA registry for Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2)
      Parameters contains some entries that are not for use with ESP or AH.
      This document does not modify the status of those algorithms.</t>

<section title="Requirements Language" anchor="sec-term">

<t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
"SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

        <c>SHOULD+</c><c>This term means the same as SHOULD. However,
        it is likely that an algorithm marked as SHOULD+ will be
        promoted at some future time to be a MUST.</c> 
        <c>SHOULD-</c><c>This term means the same as SHOULD. However,
        an algorithm marked as SHOULD- may be deprecated to a MAY in a
        future version of this document.</c>
        <c>MUST-</c><c>This term means the same as MUST. However, we
        expect at some point that this algorithm will no longer be a
        MUST in a future document. Although its status will be
        determined at a later time, it is reasonable to expect that if
        a future revision of a document alters the status of a MUST-
        algorithm, it will remain at least a SHOULD or a SHOULD-
        level.</c>
        <c>IoT</c><c>stands for Internet of Things.</c>

</section>

<section title="Manual Keying">
       <t>
        Manual Keying is not to be used as it is inherently dangerous. Without
        any keying protocol, it does not offer Perfect Forward Secrecy ("PFS")
        protection. Deployments tend to never be reconfigured with fresh session
        keys. It also fails to scale and keeping SPI's unique amongst many servers
        is impractical. This document was written for deploying ESP/AH using IKE
        (<xref target="RFC7296"/>) and assumes that keying happens using IKEv2.
       </t>
       <t>
        If manual keying is used anyway, ENCR_AES_CBC MUST be used, and
        ENCR_AES_CCM, ENCR_AES_GCM and ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 MUST NOT be used
        as these algorithms require IKE.
       </t>
</section>

<section title="Encryption must be Authenticated">
      <t>
      Encryption without authentication is not effective and MUST NOT be used.
      IPsec offers three ways to provide both encryption and authentication:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
         <t> ESP with an AEAD cipher </t>
         <t> ESP with a non-AEAD cipher + authentication </t>
         <t> ESP with a non-AEAD cipher + AH with authentication </t>
         </list> </t>

      <t>
      The fastest and most modern method is to use ESP with a
      combined mode cipher such as an  Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD) cipher that handles
      encryption/decryption and authentication in a single step. In
      this case, the AEAD cipher is set as the encryption algorithm and
      the authentication algorithm is set to none. Examples of this are
      ENCR_AES_GCM_16 and ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305.  </t>

      <t>
      A more traditional approach is to use ESP with an encryption and
      an authentication algorithm.  This approach is slower, as the data
      has to be processed twice, once for encryption/decryption and once
      for authentication. An example of this is ENCR_AES_CBC combined
      with AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256.  </t>

      <t>
      The last method that can be used is ESP+AH. This method is NOT
      RECOMMENDED. It is the slowest method and also takes up more octets
      due to the double header of ESP+AH, resulting in a smaller effective
      MTU for the encrypted data. With this method, ESP is only used for
      confidentiality without an authentication algorithm and a second
      IPsec protocol of type AH is used for authentication. An example of
      this is ESP with ENCR_AES_CBC with AH with AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256. </t>

          <postamble>
          [1] - This requirement level is for 128-bit and 256-bit keys.
                192-bit keys remain at MAY level.
          (IoT) - This requirement is to interoperate with IoT devices. Only
                  128-bit keys are at the given level.
            </postamble>
        </texttable>

         <t>IPsec sessions may have very long life time, and carry multiple packets, 
         so there is a need to move to 256-bit keys in the long term. For that purpose 
         the requirement level for 128 bit keys and 256 bit keys are at MUST 
         (when applicable). In that sense 256 bit keys status has been raised from 
         MAY in RFC7321 to MUST.</t> 

         <t>IANA has allocated codes for cryptographic algorithms that have 
         not been specified by the IETF. Such algorithms are noted as UNSPECIFIED.
         Usually, the use of theses algorithms is limited to specific cases, and the absence
         of specification makes interoperability difficult for IPsec communications. These 
         algorithms have not been mentioned in <xref target="RFC7321"/> and this document
         clarifies that such algorithms MUST NOT be implemented for IPsec communications.</t>

         <t>Similarly IANA also allocated code points for algorithms that are
         not expected to be used to secure IPsec communications. Such algorithms
         are noted as Non&nbsp;IPsec. As a result, these algorithms MUST NOT be implemented.</t>

         <t>Various older and not well tested and never widely implemented ciphers have been
         changed to MUST NOT.</t>

         <t>ENCR_3DES status has been downgraded from MAY in RFC7321 to SHOULD NOT. 
         ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 is a more modern approach alternative for ENCR_3DES
         than ENCR_AES_CBC and so it expected to be favored to replace ENCR_3DES.</t>

         <t>ENCR_BLOWFISH has been downgraded to MUST NOT as it has been deprecated for
         years by TWOFISH, which is not standarized for ESP and therefore not listed
         in this document. Some implementations support TWOFISH using a private range
         number.</t>

         <t>ENCR_NULL status was set to MUST in <xref target="RFC7321"/> and remains
         a MUST to enable the use of ESP with only authentication which is preferred
         over AH due to NAT traversal. ENCR_NULL is expected to remain MUST by protocol
         requirements.</t> 
        
         <t>ENCR_AES_CBC status remains at MUST. ENCR_AES_CBC MUST be implemented in
         order to enable interoperability between implementations that followed RFC7321.
         However, there is a trend for the industry to move to AEAD encryption, and the
         overhead of ENCR_AES_CBC remains quite large so it is expected to be replaced
         by AEAD algorithms in the long term.</t>
        
         <t>ENCR_AES_CCM_8 status was set to MAY in <xref target="RFC7321"/> and has been
         raised from MAY to SHOULD in order to interact with Internet of Things devices. As
         this case is not a general use case for VPNs, its status is expected to remain as
         SHOULD.</t>

         <t>ENCR_AES_GCM_16 status has been updated from SHOULD+ to MUST
         in order to favor the use of authenticated encryption and AEAD algorithms.
         ENCR_AES_GCM_16 has been widely implemented for ESP due to its increased
         performance and key longevity compared to ENCR_AES_CBC.</t>
         
        <t>ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305 was not ready to be considered at the time of RFC7321.
        It has been recommended by the CRFG and others as an alternative to AES-CBC and
        AES-GCM. It is also being standardized for ESP for the same reasons.
        At the time of writing, there are not enough ESP implementations of ENCR_CHACHA20_POLY1305
        to be able to introduce it at the SHOULD+ level. Its status has been set to SHOULD
        and is expected to become MUST in the long term.</t>

        <t>AUTH_NONE has been downgraded from MAY in RFC7321 to MUST NOT. The only reason NULL 
        is acceptable is when authenticated encryption algorithms are selected from 
        <xref target="sec-encr"/>. In all other cases, NULL MUST NOT be selected. As ESP and
        AH both provide authentication, one may be tempted to combine these protocols to 
        provide authentication. As mentioned by RFC7321, it is NOT RECOMMENDED to use 
        ESP with NULL authentication - with non authenticated encryption - in conjunction
        with AH; some configurations of this combination of services have been shown to be
        insecure <xref target="PD10"/>. In addition, NULL authentication cannot be
        combined with ESP NULL encryption.</t>
        
        <t>AUTH_HMAC_MD5_96 and AUTH_KPDK_MD5 were not mentioned in RFC7321.  As MD5 is known
        to be vulnerable to collisions, these algorithms MUST NOT be used. </t>

        <t>AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96 has been downgraded from MUST in RFC7321 to MUST- as 
        there is an industry-wide trend to deprecate its usage.</t>

        <t>AUTH_DES_MAC was not mentioned in RFC7321. As DES is known to be vulnerable, 
        it MUST NOT be used.</t>

        <t>AUTH_AES_XCBC_96 is set as SHOULD only in the scope of IoT, as Internet of Things 
        deployments tend to prefer AES based HMAC functions in order to avoid
        implementing SHA2. For the wide VPN deployment, as it has not been widely adopted,
        it has been downgraded from SHOULD to MAY.</t>

        <t>AUTH_AES_128_GMAC status has been downgraded from SHOULD+ to MAY. Along with 
        AUTH_AES_192_GMAC and AUTH_AES_256_GMAC, these algorithms should only be used for AH
        and not for ESP. If using ENCR_NULL, AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 is recommended for integrity.
        If using AES-GMAC in ESP without authentication, ENCR_NULL_AUTH_AES_GMAC is recommended. Therefore,
        these ciphers are kept at MAY.</t>

        <t>AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 was not mentioned in RFC7321, as no SHA2 based authentication
        was mentioned. AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 MUST be implemented in order to replace
        AUTH_HMAC_SHA1_96. Note that due to a long standing common implementation bug of this
        algorithm that truncates the hash at 96-bits instead of 128-bits, it is recommended that
        implementations prefer AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256 over AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 if they implement
        AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256.</t>

        <t>AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512_256 SHOULD be implemented as a future replacement of 
        AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_256_128 or when stronger security is required. This value has been preferred
        to AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_384, as the additional overhead of AUTH_HMAC_SHA2_512 is negligible.</t>

   <t>The security of a system that uses cryptography depends on both the
   strength of the cryptographic algorithms chosen and the strength of
   the keys used with those algorithms.  The security also depends on
   the engineering and administration of the protocol used by the system
   to ensure that there are no non-cryptographic ways to bypass the
   security of the overall system.</t>

   <t>This document concerns itself with the selection of cryptographic
   algorithms for the use of ESP and AH, specifically with the selection
   of mandatory-to-implement algorithms.  The algorithms identified in
   this document as "MUST implement" or "SHOULD implement" are not known
   to be broken at the current time, and cryptographic research to date
   leads us to believe that they will likely remain secure into the
   foreseeable future.  However, this is not necessarily forever.
   Therefore, we expect that revisions of this document will be issued
   from time to time to reflect the current best practice in this area.</t>
